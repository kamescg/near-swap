# NEAR Swap

The NEAR swap project will create a frontend for launching tokens on NEAR and easily swapping those tokens.

### Resources

Since the NEAR protocol is still new some of the mechanics will be borrowed from Ethereum i.e. ERC20 and Uniswap Contracts.

#### NEAR

- Tokens (https://github.com/near-examples/token-contract-as)

#### Ethereum

- ERC20 (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol)
- Uniswap (https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v1)
